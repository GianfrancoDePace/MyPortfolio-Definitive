# MyPortfolio-Definitive
<p>Hey, take a look.</p> 

<p>If you are interested my contacts are in bio. </p>

<p>PS. 
for a smooth vision of my portfolio i suggest you install <a href= "https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-hash-link"> react-router-hash-link"</a> library. <br>  
You can install it using this line into vscode : npm install --save react-router-hash-link </>

I tried to host my wordpress site but the my domain provider blocked it, so the solution I found was to use a live link (a feature of Local), but it runs only when i got the pc running and connected to the internet, so it may not work at all time.
